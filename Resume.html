      <p>
        A 1st-year IT student focuses on building a strong foundation in
        subjects like programming, mathematics, and basic computer science. They
        learn key skills such as coding (often in languages like Python or C++),
        problem-solving, and understanding computer systems. This year is all
        about gaining essential knowledge that will prepare them for more
        advanced topics in future semesters.

        projects that have helped me develop my skills. For example, I recently
        built a simple website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my
        coursework. Additionally, I am learning Python and have completed small
        coding challenges and automation scripts.
